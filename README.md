### Coucou 👋

My name is Hugues de Valon and I am a Senior Software Engineer working at [Arm](https://www.arm.com/).

I am currently working on the [Parsec](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec) project 🔐 I am also doing some bits for the Rust Embedded community around the Armv8-M architecture and TrustZone-M.

Feel free to reach me on Twitter, LinkedIn or by email if you have any question 🌞
